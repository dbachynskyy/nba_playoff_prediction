# NBA Playoff Series Predictor

## Overview
This project utilizes logistic regression to predict the winner of NBA playoff series based on game-level data. The aim is to simulate the outcome of playoff series multiple times to understand the distribution of possible outcomes and probabilities for each team.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to explore the application of machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression, in predicting sports outcomes. By predicting game results and simulating playoff series, I aimed to provide insights into team performance and playoff dynamics.

## Results
The project successfully predicted NBA playoff series outcomes with a high degree of accuracy in simulations(When applied to real-life 2024 playoffs, it predicted all the series correctly besides Minessota-Denver, but some adjustments were made after this issue). 

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced models for better predictive accuracy(I experimented only with regression, random forest and SVM, but I believe that a neural network would be needed to get the best insights from data).
- Expand the dataset to include more features and seasons to improve model robustness(this is a complicated task due to the game of basketball constantly evolving and us only getting as many playoff series every year).
